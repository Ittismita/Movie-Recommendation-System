# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A **hybrid recommendation system** that showcases both **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** techniques to deliver accurate, personalized movie suggestions.
The project focuses on tackling **data sparsity** in large-scale user–item datasets and optimizing top-N recommendation performance through model experimentation and ranking techniques.

## 🚀 Features

* **Hybrid Filtering Approach**
 Showcasess both *content-based* (movie features) and *collaborative filtering* (user–item interactions) methods to enhance recommendation accuracy and diversity.

* **Sparse Data Handling**

  * Works with large datasets containing millions of user–movie interactions (≈ 34M records).
  * Reduces sparsity by sampling **top-rated movies** and a **diverse user subset**, maintaining balance between **density and variety**.

* **Performance Evaluation**

  * Metrics used: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Precision–Recall**, and **AUC**.
  * Experimental phase includes **LightGBM ranking models** to boost top-N recommendation accuracy.

## 🧠 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Load and clean large-scale user–movie interaction data.
   * Filter and sample data to mitigate sparsity while preserving representativeness.

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Generate movie metadata vectors for content-based similarity.
   * Create user–item interaction matrices for collaborative filtering.

3. **Model Development**

   * Implement **Content-Based Filtering** using cosine similarity or metadata features.
   * Build **Collaborative Filtering** models via matrix factorization or nearest-neighbor techniques.
   * Combine both approaches for a **hybrid model**.

4. **Evaluation**

   * Compute MSE for rating prediction accuracy.
   * Assess top-N recommendation quality using Precision–Recall and AUC metrics.
   * Experiment with **LightGBM rankers** to refine ranking performance.
